#Lyric Matcher

So, you're a programmer ?
And you love the terminal. You do all the work there and don't really have time for going to the browser to find the name of the song you're listening to ?

No issues. Just run `get_song.py` and type in the lyrics and it'll find the song name for you !

I would suggest you type in the lyrics you find are unique to the song. A normal length is fine. Too short will yield too many results and thus result in an inaccurate answer.

Search result wasn't great ? Think you know the artist or album ? Throw in those details directly in the search, we'll handle it ! In fact, that might help the query
